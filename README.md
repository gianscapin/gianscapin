# Hello!
### Full-stack Android engineer

I'm a mobile developer since 2021.

My first programming language that I learned was Java and then I was learning languages and frameworks like Spring, Kotlin, Javascript, React, NodeJs.
In university I did multiple projects in Javascript, NodeJs and my final project was in Kotlin doing a Mobile App, this project was about finding lost animals. Doing this project in Android and Kotlin blew my mind and I fell in love with Kotlin and making mobile apps.
In 2021 I graduated from Systems Analyst and I started to work as a Software Engineer in Odea. Doing projects for mobile apps using React Native and in backend using Java and Spring.
I'm learning and making a mobile projects in native (Kotlin, Android) and hybrid (React Native) way.
